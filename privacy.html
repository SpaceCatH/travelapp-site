  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: October 9, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d is a mobile app designed to help travelers plan trips, manage packing lists, and share itineraries via email. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d does not require users to create accounts or submit personal information to use core features. However, when users choose to send trip summaries or packing lists via email, the app temporarily processes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email addresses entered by the user</li>
    <liTrip and packing list content generated by the user</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No data is stored permanently by Stamp’d. All email content is generated on-device and dispatched via Amazon SES. We do not collect analytics, location data, or device identifiers.
  </p>

  <h2>Use of Email</h2>
  <p>
    All emails sent by Stamp’d are <strong>user-initiated</strong> and <strong>transactional</strong>. The app sends content only to the addresses specified by the user. Stamp’d does not send marketing emails, newsletters, or automated messages.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d uses Amazon Web Services (SES and SNS) to send and manage email delivery. These services may process metadata for bounce and complaint handling. We do not share user data with any other third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that such information has been inadvertently collected, we will delete it promptly. Parents or guardians may contact us at <a href="mailto:jonathan.e.eng@gmail.com">jonathan.e.eng@gmail.com</a> to request removal.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use secure protocols and verified domains (SPF, DKIM) to ensure email authenticity and prevent spoofing. No user data is stored on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You may request deletion of any data you believe has been collected or processed by contacting us directly. We will respond within 30 days.
  </p>
